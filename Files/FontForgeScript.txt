The FontForge binary from http://fuuko.libferris.com/osx/packages/ has some interface problems: (i) it will run multiple copies of the executable; (ii) you can't drop one or more font files onto it to open them. This script, an AppleScript application, which is convenient to mount in a Finder window's toolbar (see http://support.apple.com/kb/PH13935) will open an existing FontForge application if double-clicked, and will open any font files dropped onto it. The app is code-signed so that it can be listed on the Accessibility panel of Security and Privacy.
